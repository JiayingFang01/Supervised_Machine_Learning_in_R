# Supervised_Machine_Learning_in_R

Sample of Supervised Machine Learning in R using the Titanic dataset 

* Use logit regression models to predict Titanic passenger survival
* Perform 5-fold cross-validation (out-of-sample prediction) to decide the best model
* Evaluate the models' performance using AUROC
* Select the best model
